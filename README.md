# Predict Rain in Australia
** By Yevgeniy Kostrov
***

# Overview 
The purpose of this project is to use weather dataset from Kaggle to predictrainfall for the next day based on the data about today's weather.

During the analysis:
1. I will analyze data.
2. I will deal with missing values



# Data Description
The file called ['weatherAUS.csv'](data/weatherAUS.csv) holds the data for this project. Taken from Kaggle: "This dataset contains about 10 years of daily weather observations from many locations across Australia. RainTomorrow is the target variable to predict. It means -- did it rain the next day, Yes or No? This column is Yes if the rain for that day was 1mm or more."
